# *.ecmb - The new Comic-Manga-eBook
**Benefits:**

- of course left to right and top-down reading for (western) Comics
- advanced support for double-pages
- content-warnings for using safe-guard
- a bunch of possible meta-data like genres and even the homepage of the publisher ([go to example >](https://github.com/metacreature/ecmb_definition/blob/master/examples/v1.0/example_full.xml))
- support for sub-chapters and many possibilities for navigation with headlines and page-links ([go to example >](https://github.com/metacreature/ecmb_definition/blob/master/examples/v1.0/advanced_book/advanced_book.ecmb_unpacked/ecmb.xml))
- validateable via XSD
- published under [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

# The project ([https://metacreature.github.io/ecmb](https://metacreature.github.io/ecmb))
**It contains:**
- the [definition](https://github.com/metacreature/ecmb_definition) of the file-format and a file-validator
- a [library](https://github.com/metacreature/ecmblib_python) for packing the eBooks
- a simple-to-use [builder](https://github.com/metacreature/ecmb_builder) for building the eBooks from your source-images
- a mobile-app for reading the eBooks is under developement
- unfortunately there is no web-scraper to download source-images, coz I guess that would be illegal in my country to publish something like that. Maybe you'll find some here: [https://github.com/topics/manga-scraper](https://github.com/topics/manga-scraper)

**If you like it I would be happy if you  [donate on checkya](https://checkya.com/1hhp2cpit9eha/payme)**


# About this repository:
This is a easy-to-use builder to build *.ecmb-files from your source-images without knowing anything about programming.

# Using the builder

### Installation
- download and install Python3 (>=3.11) [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- download and install Git [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  Here is a little guide how to install and open git console: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYtK-DS0MY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYtK-DS0MY)
- create an empty folder on your harddisk (eg. "comic_manga") and open it
- open the git-console with right-click (like you learned in the video) and then type or copy the commands to the console and press [enter] after each command:
    - `mkdir source_dir`
    - `mkdir output_dir`
    - `git clone git@github.com:metacreature/ecmb_builder.git`
    - `cd ecmb_builder`
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- after that there are 3 subfolders in your "comic_manga"-folder
- open the folder "ecmb_builder" and open the config-file `ecmb_builder_config.yml` with any simple text-editor
  (I would recommend to use [https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)) and do your settings there (or just leave it as it is).

### 1) The source-files
Your source-files have to be located in "comic_manga/source_dir" (if you didn't specify a different one in the config-file)

File-Structure:
```
source_dir/
    ˪ My_Manga_Name
        ˪ chapter_0001
             ˪ img_0000010.jpg
             ˪ img_0000020.jpg
             ˪ img_0000030.jpg
             ˪ img_0000040.jpg
        ˪ chapter_0002
        ˪ chapter_0003
        ˪ chapter_0004
        ˪ cover_front.jpg
        ˪ cover_rear.jpg
```
or 
```
source_dir/
    ˪ My_Manga_Name
        ˪ volume_001
            ˪ chapter_0001
               ˪ img_0000010.jpg
               ˪ img_0000020.jpg
               ˪ img_0000020.jpg
               ˪ img_0000030.jpg
            ˪ chapter_0002
            ˪ chapter_0003
            ˪ chapter_0004
            ˪ cover_front.jpg
            ˪ cover_rear.jpg
        ˪ volume_002
        ˪ volume_003
        ˪ volume_004
```
- the file- and folder-names can be messy - if you activated "rename" in the config-file, it will be renamed anyways
- the file- and folder-names ar sorted alphanumerc (like every file-system)
- files and folders starting with "__" (2 underscores) are ignored in general
- allowed image-extension: jpg, jpeg, png, webp
- if you have cover-images they have to have one of these names:

| Front-Cover:     | Rear-Cover:     |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| cover_front.jpeg | cover_rear.jpeg |
| cover_front.jpg  | cover_rear.jpg  |
| cover_front.png  | cover_rear.png  |
| cover_front.webp | cover_rear.webp |
| front.jpeg       | rear.jpeg       |
| front.jpg        | rear.jpg        |
| front.png        | rear.png        |
| front.webp       | rear.webp       |
| f.jpeg           | r.jpeg          |
| f.jpg            | r.jpg           |
| f.png            | r.png           |
| f.webp           | r.webp          |

**Note!** If you have many books in your source-folder you can organize them in subfolders

### 2) Initialize the book
- open the folder "ecmb_builder"
- open the git-console with right-click (like you have done before)
- type `invoke init "My_Manga_Name"`

**Note!** If you delete the created "book_config.json" you have to run init again, or if your web-scraper allready created that file you can skip this step

### 3) Preparing for build
- now you can find a "book_config.json" - file in "source_dir/My_Manga_Name/". You should open it with a simple text-editor and add the meta-data like description, genres.
Optional information you can leave empty, default or simply delete them if you don't need it. If you leave them to default they won't appear in the book.
- what the hell is `"start_with": "my_image_name.jpg#left"` at the chapters? If there is a prolog, spacer-images you don't want to delete or the chapter starts with a double-page-image its good to specify where the reader-app should jump, if you click on a chapter. When I was building ePub-files it was really confusing that the chapter started with a "random" image instead of the chapter's title-image.
- if you have downloaded the images from the web it would be a good idea to delete translation-credits and adds from your source-folder, delete/add spacer-images and maybe even swap or edit images.
- if you haven't got cover-images it would be good to add at least the front-cover.

### 4) Build the book(s)
- open the folder "ecmb_builder"
- open the git-console with right-click (like you have done before)
- type `invoke build "My_Manga_Name"` to build all volumes
- type `invoke build "My_Manga_Name" --volumes 1,2,5` if you only want to build specific volumes


__Done ... your *.ecmb-files ar now in your output-dir!__
